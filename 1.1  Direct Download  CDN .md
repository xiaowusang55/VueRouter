Unpkg.com provides npm-based CDN links. The above link will always point to the latest release on npm. You can also use a specific version/tag via URLs like <https://unpkg.com/vue-router@2.0.0/dist/vue-router.js.>

Include `vue-router` after Vue and it will install itself automatically:

```html
<script src="/path/to/vue.js"></script>
<script src="/path/to/vue-router.js"></script>
```
