# Dynamic Route Matching

Very often we will need to map routes with the given pattern to the same component. For example we may have a `User` component which should be rendered for all users but with different user IDs. In `vue-router` we can use a dynamic segment in the path to achieve that:

```js
const User = {
    template: '<div>User</div>'
}

const router = new VueRouter({
    routes: [
        { [ path: '/user/:id', component: User] }
    ]
})

```

Now URLs like /user/foo and /user/bar will both map to the same route.

A dynamic segment is denoted by a colon `:`. When a route is matched, the value of the dynamic segments will be exposed as `this.$route.params` in every component. Therefore, we can render the current user ID by updating `User`'s template to this:

```js
const User = {
    template: `
        <div> {{ $route.params.id }} </div>
    `
}
```

result: <https://jsfiddle.net/yyx990803/4xfa2f19/>

You can have multiple dynamic segments in the same route, and they will map to corresponding fields on `$route.params`. Examples:

```sh
**pattern**                        **matched path**        **$route.params**
/user/:username                    /user/evan              { username: 'evan' }
/user/:username/post/:post_id       /user/evan/post/123    { username: 'evan', post_id: '123' }
```

In addition to `$route.params`, the `$route` object also exposes other useful information such as `$route.query` (if there is a query in the URL), `$route.hash`, etc. You can check out the full details in the **API Reference**.

## Reacting to Params Changes

One thing to note when using routes with params is that when the user navigates from /`user/foo` to `/user/bar`, **the same component instance will be reused**. Since both routes render the same component, this is more efficient than destroying the old instance and then creating a new one. **However, this also means that the lifecycle hooks of the component will not be called**.

To react to params changes in the same component, you can simply watch the `$route` object:

```js
const User = {
    template: '...',
    watch: {
        '$route' (to, from) {
            // react to route changes....
        }
    }
}
```

Or, use the `beforeRouteUpdate` navigation guard introduced in 2.2:

```js
const User = {
    template: '...',
    beforeRouteUpdate (to, from, next) {
        // react to route changes...
        // don't forget to call next()
    }
}
```

## Catch all / 404 Not found Route

Regular params will only match characters in between url fragments, separated by `/`. If we want to match **anything**, we can use the asterisk (`*`):

```sh
{
    // will match everything
    path: '*'
}
{
    // will match anything starting with `/user-`
    path: '/user-*'
}
```

When using asterisk routes, make sure to correctly order your routes so that asterisk ones are at the end. The route {`path: '*'` } is usually used to 404 client side. If you are using History mode, make sure to correctly configure your server as well.

When using an asterisk, a param named `pathMatch` is automatically added to `$route.params`. It contains the rest of the url matched by the asterisk:

```js
// Given a route { path: '/user-*' }
this.$router.push('/user-admin')
this.$route.params.pathMatch // 'admin'

// Given a route { path: '*' }
this.$router.push('/non-existing')
this.$route.params.pathMatch // '/non-existing'
```

## Advanced Matching Patterns

vue-router uses **path-to-regexp** as its path matching engine, so it supports many advanced matching patterns such as optional dynamic segments, zero or more / one or more requirements, and even custom regex patterns. Check out its **documentation** for these advanced patterns, and **this example** of using them in `vue-router`.

## Matching Priority

Sometimes the same URL may be matched by multiple routes. In such a case the matching priority is determined by the order of route definition: the earlier a route is defined, the higher priority it gets.
