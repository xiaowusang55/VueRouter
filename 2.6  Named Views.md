# Named Views

Sometimes you need to display multiple views at the same time instead of nesting them, e.g. creating a layout with a `sidebar` view and a `main` view. This is where named views come in handy. Instead of having one single outlet in your view, you can have multiple and give each of them a name. A `router-view` without a name will be given `default` as its name.

```html
<router-view class="view one"></router-view>
<router-view class="view two" name="a"></router-view>
<router-view class="view three" name="b"></router-view>
```

A view is rendered by using a component, therefore multiple views require multiple components for the same route. Make sure to use the `components` (with an s) option:

```js
const router = new VueRouter({
    routes: [
        {
            path: '/',
            components: {
                default: Foo,
                a: Bar,
                b: Baz
            }
        }
    ]
})
```

## Nested Named Views

It is possible to create complex layouts using named views with nested views. When doing so, you will also need to name nested router-view components used. Let's take a Settings panel example:

```html
/settings/emails                                       /settings/profile
+-----------------------------------+                  +------------------------------+
| UserSettings                      |                  | UserSettings                 |
| +-----+-------------------------+ |                  | +-----+--------------------+ |
| | Nav | UserEmailsSubscriptions | |  +------------>  | | Nav | UserProfile        | |
| |     +-------------------------+ |                  | |     +--------------------+ |
| |     |                         | |                  | |     | UserProfilePreview | |
| +-----+-------------------------+ |                  | +-----+--------------------+ |
+-----------------------------------+                  +------------------------------+
```

* `Nav` is just a regular component
* `UserSettings` is the view component
* `UserEmailsSubscriptions`, `UserProfile`, `UserProfilePreview` are nested view components

Note: Let's forget about how the HTML/CSS should look like to represent such layout and focus on the components used.

The `<template>` section for UserSettings component in the above layout would look something like this:

```html
<!-- UserSettings.vue -->
<div>
  <h1>User Settings</h1>
  <NavBar/>
  <router-view/>
  <router-view name="helper"/>
</div>
```

Then you can achieve the layout above with this route configuration:

```js
{
    path: '/settings',
    component: UserSettings,
    children: [
        {
            path: 'emails',
            component: UserEmailSubscriptions
        },
        {
            path: 'profile',
            components: {
                default: UserProfile,
                helper: UserProfilePreview
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
